ex a*b*c*d

where a ,b, c ,d ae very large 


then we can find last two digits without multiplying


by ll value=((a%100)*(B%100)*(C%100)*(d%100))%100


if(value <10)
then we have to add 0 to it int the beginning 
cout<<"0."<<value<<"\n"l

because like a number 9100002 has last two digits as 02 but the above value will be giving only 2 so we add 0.to it


cout<<value<<"\n";
