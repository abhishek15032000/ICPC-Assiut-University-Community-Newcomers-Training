in this question i was not able to think about the edge cases
becuase of which i was failing 
but by seeking guidance i got my mistake and submitted it 


thus----
when we get an array and if we are not given that array contains distinct elements

then edge cases-
duplicate present
all are duplicates 


this is where i relaized this mistake

 sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
    vector<int>p;
    p.push_back(arr.size());
    for(int i=1;i<arr.size();i++)
    {
        if(arr[i]!=arr[i-1])
        {
            p.push_back(arr.size()-i);
        }
    }
    
    return p;
    
    this is the optimized solution provided by another programmer 
    
    
    my was naive
