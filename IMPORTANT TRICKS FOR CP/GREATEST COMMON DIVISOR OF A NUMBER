For example:

the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

because the numbers that divides both 8 and 12


8 has divisors (1,2,4,8)
12 has divisors (1,2,3,4,6,12)

now diviosrs they have in common is

(1,2,4) AND AMONG THIS 4 is the highest number they have in common so this is the GCD(greatest common divisor) aur (HIGEST COMMON FACTOR) HCF
