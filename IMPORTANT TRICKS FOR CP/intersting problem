#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int 
int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);
	string s;
	cin>>s;
	cout<<0<<" "<<0<<"\n";
	
}


this is its solution


wheneever we have non negative or non positive then one value must be 0 and other mut be c^2
pyhtogram theorem 

a^2+b^2=c^2

then we can put a=0 and b=c this would be a solution

(a*a +b*b)%n==0 so as n <=10^100 then we need a string to do it ...and then we need to find n^2 which will be diificult of such a large number 
as stoi gives upto 10^18 and no other data type can hold such big integers as maximum is 2^63-1 


so we do greedily as we know evey number divides completely 0 so both a and b can be 0 and will givve modulus 0
