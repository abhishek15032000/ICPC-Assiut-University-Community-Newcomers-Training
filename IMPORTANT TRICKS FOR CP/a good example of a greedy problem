here i was confused of how to split
then i thought of generating all such subsequences and storing only those which are not repeating like they dont have same length as the previous stirng we inserted
but it was a naive approach and i was making mistakes in its implementation



so i thought of asking someone he said it is a greedy problem 

he and i were on the same lines but my thinking was too naive ...his was simple and general 





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);  
	string s;
	getline(cin,s);
	vector<string>v;
	string k="";
	int count_l=0;
	int count_r=0;
	for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
	{
		if(s[i]=='L')
		{
			count_l++;
	     	k+=s[i];
		}
		else
		{  count_r++;
		   k+=s[i];
		}
		if(count_l==count_r)
		{
			v.push_back(k);
			k="";
		}
	}
	cout<<v.size()<<endl;
	for(auto &x:v)
	{
		cout<<x<<endl;
	}
}
