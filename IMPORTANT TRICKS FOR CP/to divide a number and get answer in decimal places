if divide an integer/integer we get only integer part but not the decimal part as it gets truncated


ex 10/3 would be give 3 only
whereas it we expect it to give 3.33333

so do this we take either numerator or denominator in double or float value 


10/3.0 this would give the required result 3.333333
