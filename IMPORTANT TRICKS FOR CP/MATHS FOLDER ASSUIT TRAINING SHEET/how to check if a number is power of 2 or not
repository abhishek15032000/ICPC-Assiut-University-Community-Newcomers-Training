I was confused as i knew log2(n) if it is integer it will be power of 2 ,,,if it had decimal values it will not be a power of 2

now i started taking direction of typeid().name() but did not get anywhere 


then i saw gfg blog where it said if the ceil(log2(n)) == (floor(log2(n))  then it is a power of 2 number else not  and 0 is not a power of 2 -EDGE CASE 


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    ll n;
    cin>>n;
    if(n==0)
    {
        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if(ceil(log2(n))==floor(log2(n)))
    {
        cout<<"YES"<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
    }
 
}
