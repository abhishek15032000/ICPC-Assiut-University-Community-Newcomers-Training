earlier i was doing the long division method only but somehow i made it complicated and made the complexity more by using functions like stoi and to string types 
but the actual problem could be solved using the same process i did but without increased complexity


CODE
////
IT DID NOT STRIKE ME THAT THERE COULD BE A WAY THE FOR LOOP COULD BE WRITTEN IN THAT WAY ALSO 



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int

int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);
	string n;ll x;
	cin>>n>>x;
	ll r=0;
	for(ll i=0;i<n.length();i++)
	{
		r=r*10+(n[i]-'0');
		if(r>=x)
		r=r%x;
	}
	if(r==0)
	cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	else
	cout<<"NO"<<endl;
}
