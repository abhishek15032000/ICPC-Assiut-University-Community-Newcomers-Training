i was applying the concepts of calculating slopes like 
for EG:- X1,Y1 
         X2,Y2
         X3,Y3
         
         i started calculating slopes =(Y2-Y1)/(X2-X1)
                               SLOPE2=(Y3-Y2)/(X3-X2)
                               
                               
                               is slopes == slopes2 are equal then these three points are collinear
                               
                               
          but it gave "RUN TIME ERROR "
          
 
 
 then i saw GFG ARTICLE ----- OF HOW TO CALCULATE (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-check-three-points-collinear/)   ----LINK
                              
                              
                              here it applied the concept of that that the triangle formed by these three points will be zero 
                              
                              so it is much easier
                              
                              area =(x1*(y2-y3)+x2*(y3-y1)+x3*(y1-y2))
                              
                              if (area == 0)
                              cout<<"YES"<<"\n";
                              else
                              cout<<"NO"<<"\n";
