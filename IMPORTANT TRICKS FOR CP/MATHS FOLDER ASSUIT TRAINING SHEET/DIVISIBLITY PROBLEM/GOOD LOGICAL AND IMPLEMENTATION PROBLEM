i tried many techniques from brute force -which gave tle

and tried on optimization on like 


i=0;
sum=0;
while(i<=b)
{
   if(i>=a and i<=b)
   sum=sum+i;
   
   i=i+x;
}


this only passed 6 test cases 

then i gave thought on ap and started figuring out the formula ....i knew n/2(first+last) was to be used here...but how to get n correctly and first 
and last within range was a problem ..i tried until i saw a gfg article which explained it very nicely



https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-all-numbers-in-the-given-range-which-are-divisible-by-m/    -----GFG PROBLEM LINK SOLUTION



then i implemented it and i saw the explanation of steps it did and why it did


like why it did first<A to first=first+x to bring in RANGE
and last>B to last=last-x to bring in range 

[A,B]


how to calculate n=(B)/x- (A-1)/x;

CODE////


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int


ll findleft(ll a,ll x)
{
    if(a%x==0)
    return a;

    ll remainder=a%x;
    return (a-remainder);
}


ll findright(ll b,ll x)
{
    ll remainder=(b+x)%x;
    if(remainder==0)
    {
        return b;
    }
    return (b+x-remainder);
}


ll calculate_sum(ll a,ll b,ll x)
{
   ll L=findleft(a,x);
   ll R=findright(b,x);

   if(L<a)
   {
       L=L+x;
   }
   if(R>b)
   {
       R=R-x;
   }

   ll terms=(b/x)-(a-1)/x;

   ll ans=(terms)*(L+R)/2;
   return ans;
}

int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    ll a,b,x;
    cin>>a>>b>>x;
    if(a>=b)
    {
        cout<<calculate_sum(b,a,x)<<"\n";
    }
    else
    {
       cout<<calculate_sum(a,b,x)<<"\n";
    }
}
