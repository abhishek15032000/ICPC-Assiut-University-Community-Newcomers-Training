https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/space-and-time-efficient-binomial-coefficient/   ----GFG ARTICLE OF HOW TO CALCULATE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT FAST AND CONSUME LESS SPACE 
AT THE SAME TIME


at first i was doing the mistake of calculating nCr using fact(n)/(fact(r)*fact(n-r)) this solution worked fine for caluclating binomial coefficients
for low VALUE OF "N"

BUT WHEN N BECAME LARGE OVERFLOW HAPPENED EVEN LONG LONG INT WON'T HANDLE IT 

SO I SAW THIS ARTICLE WHERE IT CALCULATED BINOMIAL COEEFICIENTS IN A FASTER WAY WITHOUT OVERFLOW

nCr=nC(n-r) we can caluclate doing this also



so it used this property but the catch is r is smaller

if (k<n-k) like if calulate 6C2 then 2 <4 so it would be more feasible to calucalte 6C2  to avoid large computation

but if k>n-k  like 6C5 HERE 5>6-5 THEN IT WOULD BE MORE FEASIBLE TO CALCULATE 6C1 to avoid computations


"the only thing here was to decide when to use k and when to use n-k if (k<n-K) we can use k itslef 
  if not then we would use n-k to reduce our computations "
  
  
  
  CODE//
  
  
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define mod 100000000000000007

ll binomial_coefficient(ll n,ll k)
{
    if(k>n-k)
    k=n-k;

    ll res=1;
    for(ll i=0;i<k;i++)
    {
        res*=(n-i);
        res/=(i+1);
    }
    return res;
}

int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    ll n;
    cin>>n;
    ll res=1;
    for(ll i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        for(ll j=0;j<i;j++)
        {
           cout<<binomial_coefficient(i-1,j)<<" ";
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
