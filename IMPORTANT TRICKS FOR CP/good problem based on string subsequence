earlier i got tle as i did it the naive way by generating all subsequences of a string and then finding maximum among them which does not have adjacents repeating
...but the constraints were high as 10^5 so it wouldn't pass 


very interesting approach to solve this problem


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);
	ll n;
	cin>>n;
	cin.get();
	string s;
	cin>>s;
    int count=0;
    char h='.';
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
    	if(h!=s[i])
    	{
    		h=s[i];
    		count++;
    	}
    }
    cout<<count<<endl;
}
