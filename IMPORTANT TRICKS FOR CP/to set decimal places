here fixed has the meaning that in the value of x the values before decimal are fixed and the number of decimal places we want can get by setprecision(n) where n is 
the no of decimal places you want 



if we dont write fixed and then give only setprecision(n) then this n will tell us about how many integers will be there in the answer in which dcimal point is 
also included

for ex-3.3335894
cout<<setprecision(n)<<x<<endl;
if n=6 it would give 3.3335  whereas it should be giving 3.333589



to get 3.333589 we use fixed in the print statement so that the values before the decimal part are not included in this n 
and we want n only to tell the decimal places we want


cout<<fixed<<setprecision(n)<<x<<endl;
