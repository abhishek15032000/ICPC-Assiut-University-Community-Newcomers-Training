a number is called a prime numeber if no other nother other than( 1 and the number itsef ) divides it 


like for ex 7 only 1 can divide 7 and 7 can divide itself but no other number can completely divide the number 7 so it has only two divisors

so it is a prime number



NOTE:-1 is not a prime number ,,neither a composte number


composite numbers are those which have one extra number which divides the number other than ( 1 and the number itself)


ex :15 it has (1,15) and 3 so it is a composite number



FACT CHECK := the divisors of a number always occur in pair as (A,B)

where a and b both divide N

the formula is 

A X B =N

if we know A then we can calucalate B also 


and a FACT :- A will alwasys lie below sqrt(N) and B will always lie above sqrt(N) 

and A and B both will be AT SQRT(N) in case if N is a perfect square like for 25 it has divisor 5 and 5 which are sqrt(25)


SO 5*B=25
so B=5


if(n==1)
return false;
else
for(int i=2;i*i<=n;i++)
{
   if(n%i==0)
   {
     return false;
  }
}
return true;
