here i did what i found intutive that count total no of e's and y's and p's and g's and t's which includes capital and smal letters 


and then divide by 5 because egypt is  five letter word 


but in this what could happen is that we could have duplicates in the group


my approach made groups but never made sure that they form the word egypt or not



so i thought and did some paper work

like if there are lets say n e's
then in each group there should be e or E unitl n becomes zero that means until i could form a word egypt until i have all characters present to make it


so as we are making up words there counts are decreasing so...now 
the most common ans ...would be that no of words could be formed using those words would me minimum of count of all characters 


as soon as anyone characters count gets to 0 ,,,,we can not make egpyt
