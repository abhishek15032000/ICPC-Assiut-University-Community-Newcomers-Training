a problem where a and b were given 
where a and b , a and b are integers 
a= no of odd numbers
b= no of even numbers

we are given an interval of 0 till 100

we need to give yes or no 

if there exist and interval for which there are a no of odd numbers and b number of even numbers



since we need a +b numbers

if sum is even then that means that no of odds == no of evens 


as for 1st 10 numbers it is a fact that there are 5 even and 5 odd numbers

and it for all
like 20-30 and 30-40 

so in 1 -100 we have 50 even and 50 odd numbers


if sum is even then odd ==even as 10 was also even and we have same no of odd and even integers

whereas in case of sum is odd we can have

either one of them greater than each other by atmost 1 

like no of odd or no of evens in the interval will be greater than the other exactly by 1

if it not this then we dont have a valid interval for such a and b
