here if we are given in APAC format where we need to take input for our program from 
some file and give output in some file


for exmaple take input 
from:addin.txt
output:addout.txt


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  freopen("addin.txt","r",stdin);
  freopen("addout.txt","w",stdout);
  int a,b;
  cin>>a>>b;
  int sum=a+b;
  cout<<sum<<"\n";
}


here using namespace std is used because we dont want to write everywhere we write cin and cout
that it comes from namespace std
like std::cin>>a
std::cout<<a;

so we already specify that cin and cout come from namespace std -by writing namespace std
