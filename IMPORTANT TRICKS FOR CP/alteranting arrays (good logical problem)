https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/329103/problem/E    ----- alteranting arrays problem 




here i did miss an approach of doing it  
i made a msitake in which i tried to find how many operations we take to make it alternating the ooriginal array

and the no of steps takent to make it alteranting if it is sorted ...then i would take minimum of these two count and print them  ...but it was a wrong solution




the real solution was 
the alteranting sequence would be 
like for ex:-
+1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1
(start from positive element )

or 

-1 +1 -1 +1 -1 +1 1
(start from -negative element)



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);
	ll n;
	cin>>n;
	vector<int>v;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		ll x;
		cin>>x;
		v.push_back(x);
	}
    int count1=0;int count2=0;
    //+1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
    	if(i%2==1)
    	{
    		if(v[i]>0)
    		{
    			count1++;
    		}
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		if(v[i]<0)
    		{
    			count1++;
    		}
    	}
    }
    
    //-1 +1 -1 +1 -1 +1
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
    	if(i%2==1)
    	{
    		if(v[i]<0)
    		{
    			count2++;
    		}
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		if(v[i]>0)
    		{
    			count2++;
    		}
    	}
    }
    cout<<min(count1,count2)<<endl;
}

here i assume that each odd index would have negative number if not then i need to convert it and it would cost a step
and each positve number is at even position and will be positive ,if it is not postive then i need to make it positive that would cost me a step
so this would be the count....in order to make it look like +1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 what is the cost i will incur that is in count1



and similarly i did it for the other format like -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 +1 

so here i assume the even index will hold a  positive value and odd index is holding a negative value

if not then i need to change those numbers into the above format and that would incur some cost and is stored in count2


so i take minimum of (count1,count 2) and print it....that would be the minimum no of steps to make it an alteranting array
